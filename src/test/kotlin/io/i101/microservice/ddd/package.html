    1. MainApplicationTests: Test all end-points with full Spring context app.
    /context/version/path => Named test: if GET /account/v1.2/profile then GET_account_v1_2_profile or `GET /account/v1.2/profile`
    If you need create new *IntegrationTests and put some endpoints in that => consider new microservice first.

    2. *Specs: Unit tests, don't need start Spring Boot, and use Spectrum Mockito AssetJ..
    Sample *Specs only => PingServiceImplSpecs
    Sample *Specs with mocks => PingControllerSpecs
